    - Define data models for users, media, and transcripts.

    ### Month 2: Video Processing and Visual AI
    - Handle video file uploads and processing.
    - Set up a task queue (Celery & Redis) for long-running media processing tasks.
    - Integrate a Computer Vision model (e.g., BLIP-2) for image description.
    - Develop a proof-of-concept script that extracts keyframes from a video and generates descriptions.

    ## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Months 3-4)

    ### Month 3: Frontend Development and API Finalization
    - Build a simple user interface (React or HTMX) for file uploads and viewing.
    - Display a video with synchronized, generated subtitles and audio descriptions.
    - Finalize the APIs for tracking the status of processing tasks in real-time.
    - Implement interface customization options (subtitle size, color).

    ### Month 4: Live Subtitling and Deployment
    - Prototype real-time subtitling via WebSockets.
    - Deploy the MVP to a cloud service (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS).
    - Conduct an initial testing session with a group of target users.
    - Collect feedback and prioritize improvements.

    ## Phase 3: Public Beta and Evolution (Months 5-6)

    ### Month 5: Optimization and Multilingual Support
    - Optimize processing pipelines for performance and cost.
    - Integrate a translation API (e.g., DeepL API) for subtitles.
    - Enhance the interface's accessibility following WCAG standards.
    - Strengthen security and data privacy management.

    ### Month 6: Launch and Monitoring
    - Set up monitoring and error reporting tools (e.g., Sentry).
    - Prepare documentation for end-users and developers.
    - Launch the platform as a public beta and open sign-ups.
    - Establish a communication plan to reach relevant communities.

    ## Key Technical Principles

    - **API-First Approach**: Develop a robust API before building the user interface.
    - **Asynchronous Tasks**: Use workers for all heavy processing to avoid blocking the interface.
    - **Continuous Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests from the start of the project.
    - **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate deployments for fast and reliable updates.

    ## Testing Strategy

    - **Unit Tests**: For each backend function and frontend component.
    - **Integration Tests**: To validate complete workflows (upload, process, display).
    - **Accessibility Tests**: Use tools like Axe to ensure WCAG compliance.
    - **Manual Tests**: By users from target communities before each major launch.
